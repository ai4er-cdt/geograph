# Source code folder

All re-usable source code for the project goes here.

The source folder is structured as follows:
```
src
├── __init__.py    <- Makes src a Python module
│
├── constants.py   <- Includes project wide constants for easy imports
│
├── data_loading   <- Scripts to download or generate data
|
├── preprocessing  <- Scripts to turn raw data into clean data and features for modeling
│
├── models         <- Scripts to train models and then use trained models to make
│                     predictions
│
├── tests          <- Scripts for unit tests of your functions
│
└── visualisation  <- Scripts to visualise GeoGraphs
```

This generic folder structure is useful for most project, but feel free to adapt it to your needs.
