    Return list of all node ids in `other_graph` which identify with the given `node`.

    Args:
        node (dict): The node for which to find nodes in `other_graphs` that can be
            identified with `node`.
        other_graph (GeoGraph): The GeoGraph object in which to search for

            to "corner".
            The different modes correspond to different rules for identification:
            - corner: Polygons of the same `class_label` which overlap, touch in their
                edges or corners will be identified with each other. (fastest)
            - edge: Polygons of the same `class_label` which overlap or touch in their
                edges will be identified with each other.
            - interior: Polygons of the same `class_label` which overlap will be
                identified with each other. Touching corners or edges are not counted.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: List of node ids in `other_graph` which identify with `node`.
