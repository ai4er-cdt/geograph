# How to create Sphinx docs


With the dev environment activated, and Sphinx installed you can create the html version by running the following command from this directory:

```
make html
```

And for the pdf version use

```
make latexpdf
```

Note: this last command requires a latex installation, which Jasmin servers don't seem to have.
